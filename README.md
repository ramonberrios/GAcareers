# GAcareers
A guide to careers support

# Career Support Guide - Web Development Immersivee 

Congratulations on being accepted to the Web Development Immersive course. In this guide, will be everything that we will cover over the next 12 weeks and beyond. The Careers Outcome team is excited to work with you on your journey through the course and into a career.

The Careers Team will help you build a foundation for your post GA job search. We will provide you with the tools are best practices.

A few things you’ll be accountable for completing: Graduate Information Form (pre-career week), the Career Week Feedback Form (after Career Week), and the Employment Verification Form (post-employment).

Career Week runs from Monday to Friday the week after Graduation. Each day, Career Week starts at 10:00am and ends at 5:00pm with lunch running from 12:30 pm - 2:00 pm. Yes, we still participate in 2:00 pm standups.

### Job Search Expectations
If learning to code at DBC is like being in freefall, Career Week is like finally pulling the ripcord on your parachute. Coming out of the program and moving into a slower, less structured phase can be jarring.

Your job search is going to feel weird. Lean into it. There are going to be high highs and low lows. The great part is you’re going to go through the extremes together as a cohort. It’s going to be rough, but it’s going to lead to your new career life.

It may seem weird to compete with your cohort mates for jobs. Although, the cohorts that do the best are the ones who lean on each other and just acknowledge the awkwardness of competition. Your ability to support one another will help smooth out the highs and lows of a prolonged search. After the DBC experience, it is easy to feel isolated and uncertain.

Stay active with your coding projects during the job! You have learned a lot over the last 9-15 weeks onsite, but it’s all short-term memory. Use it or you'll lose it! You will need to balance your job search with growing as a developer. We'll be focusing on how to manage your time to balance everything!

Your job search is probably going to take longer than you think. The broader and more flexible your expectations are, the easier your job search will be. Don’t rule out internships and apprenticeships. Many people turn down three month internships, only to continue job searching for three months when they could have been coding every day and searching too.
Graduating from DBC is tough, but finding a job is even tougher. Career Week provides tools that help grads search smarter, not harder. So breathe, get support, and get ready to lean in!

##Prep Work
[This activity](./Resources/WCIYP) will be the first workshop Monday morning. Be sure to complete the Petal Exercise from Chapter 7 over the weekend leading up to career week.

###Activities

* [Chapter 7](./Resources/WCIYP/Ch 7 - What Color Is Your Parachute 2015.pdf)
* [Printable Petal Exercise](./Resources/WCIYP/Blank Flower Diagram.pdf)


Here are the other resources that go along with this exercise.

Pro tips:

* Spend ~15-20 minutes on each petal (there are seven), you can always come back to one or two later on
* Ignore the prioritizing grid, it's too time consuming
* Petal 3 can be a time suck. Think of several scenarios but don't feel the need to come up with​ seven​ detailed ones, the skills are more important than separate situations to pull them from.
* Petal 5 is a good basic financial planning exercise, if you haven't gone through something like it recently, it could be helpful
* ​Petal 7 is deep - ​read over the prompt, give yourself time to reflect and come up with your "kingdom.​"

Here's [the schedule](./Resources/Career Week Schedule Jul 24 2015.pdf) for this week.
