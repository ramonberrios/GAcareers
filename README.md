## Week1

Welcome to Career Week! I'm excited to kick off this journey with you.

### Activities

* [Resume Writing](./Resume.md)
* [Build Your LinkedIn](./LinkedIn.md)


### Prep for Tomorrow

* Write out your 30 second and two minute elevator pitch.


### Stretch Activities

* [Personal Sites](./Personal_Site.md)
* [Prep your Github for Employers](./Resources/github-overview_Josh's Version.pdf)

### Activities

* [Chapter 7](./Resources/WCIYP/Ch 7 - What Color Is Your Parachute 2015.pdf)
* [Printable Petal Exercise](./Resources/WCIYP/Blank Flower Diagram.pdf)


Here are the other resources that go along with this exercise.

Pro tips:

* Spend ~15-20 minutes on each petal (there are seven), you can always come back to one or two later on
* Ignore the prioritizing grid, it's too time consuming
* Petal 3 can be a time suck. Think of several scenarios but don't feel the need to come up with​ seven​ detailed ones, the skills are more important than separate situations to pull them from.
* Petal 5 is a good basic financial planning exercise, if you haven't gone through something like it recently, it could be helpful
* ​Petal 7 is deep - ​read over the prompt, give yourself time to reflect and come up with your "kingdom.​"

Here's [the schedule](./Resources/Career Week Schedule Jul 24 2015.pdf) for this week.
