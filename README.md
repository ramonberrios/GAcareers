Here are the other resources that go along with this exercise.

Pro tips:

* Spend ~15-20 minutes on each petal (there are seven), you can always come back to one or two later on
* Ignore the prioritizing grid, it's too time consuming
* Petal 3 can be a time suck. Think of several scenarios but don't feel the need to come up with​ seven​ detailed ones, the skills are more important than separate situations to pull them from.
* Petal 5 is a good basic financial planning exercise, if you haven't gone through something like it recently, it could be helpful
* ​Petal 7 is deep - ​read over the prompt, give yourself time to reflect and come up with your "kingdom.​"
